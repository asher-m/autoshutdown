# self-controller
When your self control fails...

A simple script that shuts down your machine if you're not busy and it's past your bedtime.  Specifically, the script will check if any programs that have been defined the halt shutdown are open.  If none of these programs are opened, the user is alerted that the machine will shut down in 2 minutes.
